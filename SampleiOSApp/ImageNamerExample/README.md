Cat2CatExample - iOS
=======================
----

Here is an example of how `Cat2Cat` can be used to make getting UIImages out of an asset catalog far less painful.

Included are:
 
* An iOS application which makes use of the generated `UIImage+AssetCatalog` files.
* An example aggregate target with a shell script to automatically regenerate the `UIImage+AssetCatalog` files with the touch of a button.
