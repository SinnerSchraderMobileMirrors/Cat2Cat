Cat2CatExample - iOS + Swift
=======================
----

Here is an example of how `Cat2Cat` can be used to make getting `UIImages` out of an asset catalog far less painful.

Included are:
 
* An iOS application which makes use of the generated `Cat2CatUIImage.swift` file.
* An example aggregate target with a shell script to automatically regenerate the `Cat2CatUIImage.swift` file with the touch of a button.
